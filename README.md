This is an experiment in generating music with a recurrent neural network. In its current state it's really bad. Some of the generated music is interesting in how dissonant and creepy it is, but I think there are some issues in how it's training. It's very unstable and seems to get worse over time when trained on multiple songs. 
I'll probably come back to this at some point when I'm more familiar with PyTorch, or with a different ML package entirely.
